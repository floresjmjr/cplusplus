# Sudoku Solver and Exercises
- An application that solves an easy sudoku puzzle through deduction (as opposed to backtracking).
- The application served as an exercise to demonstrate our learning a new programing language (C++).
- Exercise folder contains files of the various useful simple exercises that helped learn the new language.

Assumptions
- User is inputing the correct information as there's no check for whether input is int, etc
- The input puzzle will be an easy sudoku

Functionality
- The applicaiton is able to 
  - read a sudoku from a text file,
  - display the sudoku state,
  - to solve an easy sudoku puzzle,
  - validate whether the sudoku puzzle is correct.

Stretch Goals
- Started implementing a javascript file that would contain code to scrape an easy sudoku from the internet
- Started looking and would have liked to into invest time into obtaining a sudoku puzzle from an api
- Would have liked to explore the possiblity of 'extracting' the sudoku through Object Character Recognition, using the OpenCV library.
